The fastEDM package implements a series of tools that can be used for empirical dynamic modeling. The core algorithm is written in C++ to achieve a reasonable execution speed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fastEDM from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EDM-Developers/fastEDM")
```

## Example: Chicago crime levels and temperature

This example, looking at the causal links between Chicago's temperature and crime rates, is described in full in our [paper](https://jinjingli.github.io/edm/edm-wp.pdf):

```{r example, code=xfun::read_utf8('man/chicago-example.R')}
